# Homebrew bundling and Brewfile

I use Brewfile to manage my Homebrew packages. The battery-included `brew bundle` command was inadequate to manage
Brew-installed packages, so I opted to use [homebrew-file].

## Installations

Run the following script to install brew and the gang.

```sh
$ setup_brew.sh
```

## Included apps

- EVkey for typing Vietnamese dialects
- Discord for community chats
- iTerm2 for terminal uses
- LogiOptions+ because of my Logitech MX Master 3 mouse
- Obsidian for notes
- Visual Studio Code as my daily code editor
