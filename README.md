# .files for MacOS

_And a tiny guide to setup a fresh MacBook Pro_

I recently wiped clean my Intel MacBook Pro 2018 to have a fresh start. Even though I have had a few tries at managing
my dotfiles with Git[^dotfiles-old] [^dotfiles-wsl] [^dotfiles-company-computer], I decided to start a new one learning
from my previous mistakes. With that being said, the [dotfiles-company-computer] should be used to setup a new MacBook
provided to me by my employers.

## Key points

- I try to manage all of my apps using [Homebrew][brew.sh].
- There are a few exceptions, mainly because I want the following apps handle their own updates:
    - 1Password
    - Arc browser
